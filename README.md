In this project, we used deep CNN networks to denoise images, which are noised by guassian noise with noise level of sigma =30. Our network output is a residual image, so we get the clean image by subtracting input from output. We used a VGG like architecture with batch normalization and relu activation function. We trained three model, In first model regular 3*3 cnn filters is used. In our second model in order to increase the receptive filed, which is an important factor in image denoising task, we used dilated filters with dilation = 2. Finally, in third model we used multi column dilated cnn whith dilation = 1 and dilation =2 and then merged them. We compared the three models with 20 epoch runs and got a better results with multi-scaled dilated model.
